\section{Outline}
We built some siiiick IFUs that one time. Let's talk about how we did it. This
\emph{could} just be a more-or-less drop in of Wood et al 2012, although I'm
not sure how legit that is. The other option is to not include this as a
chapter explicately and instead just reference the Wood paper in Chapter
\ref{chap:gradpak_obs}.

\section{Schedule}
Either this is copied from Wood et. al 2012 or doesn't exist. Either way I
don't see it taking more than 1 day.
