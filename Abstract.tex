Studies of the Milky Way show that the vertical velocity dispersion of
stars in the disk tends to increase with age. However it is not clear
how this ``heating'' ties into the formation of the observed Milky Way
disk structure, and disk galaxies in general. In this thesis I present
a study of stellar populations in NGC 891 that adds information to our
information on the structure of galaxies outside the Milky Way.

This study was enabled by the construction of HexPak/\GP, two fiber
integral field units that together form the worlds first dual-head,
multi-pitch fiber instrument. Specifically, the unique design of \GP
allowed for the rapid collection of high quality data over a large
range in surface brightness and at a high filling factor. 
% When designing HexPak/\GP I investigated sources of fiber focal
% ratio degredation and found that surface scattering likely plays a
% large role in the degredation of light emitted by fiber optics.

Using \GP I find that the overall picture of disk heating in NGC 891
is remarkably similar to trends measured in the Milky Way; the
presence of young populations is abruptly cut off at \asim 1 scale
height. Furthermore I find that populations generally get younger
farther from the center of NGC 891, which is perhaps the signature of
an inside-out formation scenario.

Finally, I identify three distinct features in NGC 891: (i) a primary
disk(s) that exhibits the same general trends seen in the Milky Way,
(ii) a flared extension of this disk at large radii ($>
\val{8}{kpc}$), and (iii) a super metal-rich sequence of stars at
large radii and heights that is difficult to explain, but is perhaps
the remnant of some very early flare.
