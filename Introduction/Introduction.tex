\section{Outline}
Let's get motivated! The big question is ``where are different types
(young/old) of stars in galaxies? And what can the location of different
populations tell us about star formation in the galaxy and/or how the galaxy
formed?'' Along the way we'll have to do some cool stuff, namely designing and
building an instrument, researching better use of fiber optics, developing new
tools to reduce data, and ultimately using newly aquired data to get clues
that will allow us (or future astronomers) to answer the above questions.

The rest of this thesis talks about those cool steps.

\section{Schedule}
This probably the last section to be written. Hopefully once the rest of the
thesis is written this section will come together in a few days.
