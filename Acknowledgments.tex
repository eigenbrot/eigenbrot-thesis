\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Humans cannot live on work alone, and without a good outlet for frustration and pent up energy I would probably be on a lot more governmental watchlists. Credit must first be given to Matt Bershady\footnote{MAB, if you're nasty}; without your expert guidence and truly shocking (dangerous?) willingness to listen to what I had to say none of this would have been possible. You always pushed me just past my comfort zone and told me what to do, not how to do it. Until I did it wrong. The past six years rank extremely high in the epochs of my developement as a legit scientist, and expect them to remain there for a long time.

Beneath the Ivory Tower, in the beautiful slums of grad school, the passage of time has been eased immeasurably by many of my fellow travelers. To Danielle and Britt, your feline obsession did little to temper the... To the Atom: Anna, Chris, Jenna, and John; thanks for giving me a couch that I could use to get away from the cat talk. That and a lot of snacks and scientifc insight. Special mention is gladly given to Jenna, who unwittingly accompanied me throught the last 10 years; from throwing lemons at East to biking to Michael's, it's been real. To Diego, DK, Julie, and Max; the Young Blood that keeps me energized; thanks for reducing the thickness of my jade layer with your youthful enthusiasm and adorable 1st year problems. Me g\`usta. To Claire, 

It would be impossible understate the importance of my family to my apparent success. Unwavering support, unconditional love, and copious amounts of Night Train are all crucial ingrediants in the foundation of this work.

To Mary, you have been with me through the thickest and the thinnest and for that I will be forever grateful. You drive me to be the person you think I am and are always willing to forgive my failings.

To Anna, the best student I ever had, your steadfast determination to move forward, despite the fear and uncertainty is a continuuing inspiration.

Thank you so much to The Begowatts, members past and present; you gave me an outlet for the squishier parts of my brain and something to do when I just wanted to hit something.

A very special thanks to the City Bar for being a refuge from the storm. Kevin and MJ, you are the best bartenders I've ever had the privilage to buy beer from; thanks for providing a welcoming environment and slinging wicked suds.

And finally, without music to dull the baser parts of my psyche none of this would have happend. In the end recognition must be given to The Boss for remininding me that being earnest is cool, The Band for so much joy (and especially ``Ophelia''), NRW\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ77vdqYbuGbCAWB62WbqQ}} for a great background, and B{\"O}C for being with me from the beginning.
