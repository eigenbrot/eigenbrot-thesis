\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Humans cannot live on work alone, and without a good outlet for frustration and pent up energy I would probably be on a lot more governmental watchlists. Thank you so much to The Begowatts, members past and present; you gave me an outlet for the squishier parts of my brain and something to do when I just wanted to hit something.

A very special thanks to the City Bar for being a refuge from the storm. Kevin and MJ, you are the best bartenders I've ever had the privilage to buy beer from; thanks for providing a welcoming environment and slinging wicked suds.

And finally, without music to dull the baser parts of my psyche none of this would have happend. In the end recognition must be given to The Boss for remininding me that being earnest is cool, The Band for so much joy (and especially ``Ophelia''), NRW\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZ77vdqYbuGbCAWB62WbqQ}} for a great background, and B{\"O}C for being with me from the beginning.
