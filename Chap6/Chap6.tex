\section{Outline}
Hey, remember all the fun with SALT data? I sure do. We got pretty damn close
to having something cool a few times. I think the most concise and impactful
realization of this analysis was the stuff I present at Galaxies in 3D across
the Universe in Vienna, 2014.

\section{Schedule}
This is pretty tricky. If we want to persue any new analysis the potential for
lots of work becomes very high. I estimate that even just pulling together all
the basic information from various posters/proceedings/paper drafts into a
coherent chapter will take a week.
