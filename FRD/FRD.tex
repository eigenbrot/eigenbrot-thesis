\section{Outline}
This is the work I did during my first two years. It was published in an SPIE
conference proceedings and is thus already done.

\section{Schedule}
This will take a maximum of 1 day to get all the formatting correct. No new
work has been done since the publication of the proceedings so it's pretty
much a drop in job.
