\section{Outline}
Right now this is just a conclusion of the schedule for thesis completion

\section{Schedule}
If you go and add up all the schedule sections you get something like 6 weeks
for completion. Honestly I think this is a bit of an overestimate \emph{in
  terms of just writing the thesis}. The harder thing to quantify are the
remaining analysis components. The big ones are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Final SSP weights - we are \emph{so close} on this
  \item Which indices to use
  \item Heating model
\end{itemize}

We have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes sometimes, but if we keep our
eyes on the prize this can (and will!) all be done.
