\chapter[NGC 891: Full Spectrum Analysis]{Vertical Population Gradients in NGC 891 II. Spectral Analysis}
\label{chap:891_2}

  We report the results of applying full-spectrum fitting methods to
  IFU data from NGC 891. The edge-on nature of this galaxy allows us
  to use line centroid velocity measurements to deproject on-sky radii
  to get a fully 3D picture of the location of our data in this
  galaxy. Our data are fit using a set of only 4 SSPs chosen, through
  statistical methods, to be a basis set for much larger SSP
  libraries. We attempt to refine the standard $\chi^2$ metric to make
  it more sensitive to spectral regions that encode information about
  age and metallicity, but find that this greatly increases
  uncertainty in our fits. Full spectral fits produce measurements of
  age, metallicity, and extinction as a function of height and radis
  in NGC 891. In this phase space we identify three key features: (i)
  a star forming disk below $|z| = \val{0.4}{kpc}$, (ii) a flared
  extension of this disk extending to $|z| = \val{1}{kpc}$ at radii
  beyond \val{8}{kpc}, and (iii) a high-metallicity sequence at large
  radii and large heights. We are also able to make rough estimates
  about the star formation history of NGC 891.

% We have determined the vertical population gradients in age and
% metallicity in the disk of NGC 891 based on optical spectroscopy.
% These gradients, measured over a range of projected radii, are
% combined with estimates of the dust attenuation as a function of
% radius and height. Using a parameterization of the radial population 
% gradients in the disk plane, we model the heating rate in this spiral
% disk and compare it to estimates in the Milky Way solar neighborhood.
% This abstract will get augmented as we consolidate our results and
% make decisions about how we undertake the analysis and what object to
% include. Here and in the following manuscript outline the text gives a
% description of possible content and analysis choices.  These should be
% viewed as suggestions to be edited and commented out or deleted as
% items are completed.
