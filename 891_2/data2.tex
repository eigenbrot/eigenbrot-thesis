\section{Data}
\label{891_2:sec:data}
The data used in this paper were recorded using \GP \citep{Wood12} on
the WIYN\footnote{The WIYN Observatory is a join facility of the
  University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, NASA, and the
  National Optical Astronomy Observatory.} telescope Bench
Spectrograph \citep{Barden94,Bershady08,Knezek10}. In
\ref{chap:891_1} we detail the observational methodology,
data reduction, and spectral coadding used to produce spectra that
will be used in this work. Briefly, spectra were extracted and reduced
primarily using standard IRAF tasks with some custom modifications to
account for the unique nature of \GP. The individual fibers were then
coadded to produce ``aperture'' spectra that have signal to noise
$\geq 30$. We refer the reader to \ref{chap:891_1} and the
suplimental data therein for an in-depth discussion of all of these
steps and tables listing the details of each aperture (location,
constituent fibers, etc.).

In the online materials for this paper we provide spectra for all
apertures from this paper and \ref{chap:891_1}. We also
provide the full set of spectra that after they have been corrected to
remove Balmer emission as detailed in \S\ref{sec:emission_corr}.
