\section{Data}
\label{891_2:sec:data}
The data used in this paper were recorded using \GP \citep{Wood12} on
the WIYN\footnote{The WIYN Observatory is a join facility of the
  University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, NASA, and the
  National Optical Astronomy Observatory.} telescope Bench
Spectrograph \citep{Barden94,Bershady08,Knezek10}. In Chapter
\ref{chap:891_1} we detail the observational methodology, data
reduction, and spectral coadding used to produce the spectra that will
be used in this work. Briefly, spectra were extracted and reduced
primarily using standard IRAF tasks with some custom modifications to
account for the unique nature of \GP. The individual fibers were then
coadded to produce ``aperture'' spectra that have signal to noise
$\geq \val{30}{px^{-1}}$ (\val{\asim 20}{\AA^{-1}}). We refer the
reader to Chapter \ref{chap:891_1} and Appendix
\ref{chap:full_ap_table} for an in-depth discussion of all of these
steps and tables listing the details of each aperture (location,
constituent fibers, etc.).
